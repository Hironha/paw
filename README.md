An incomplete implementation of JSON schema parsing inspired by `zod` made to investigate how powerful Typescript type system is and what are it's edge cases. This implementation is meant to be used as a learning resource and not as a production ready library. It's key advantages over `zod` is it's simplicity and performance for safe parsing, since all the safe parse errors are stackless.
